						<p>Staring at your computer screen for long periods of time can strain your eyes and lead to permanent vision damage. This is why it's important to give your eyes a break. For every 20 minutes, you should focus on something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</p>
						<p>Press the start button and look away. Your computer will chime and the screen will flash when the 20 seconds is up.</p>
